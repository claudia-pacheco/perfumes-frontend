## Project 4: Cloud9 Scents ☁️

This is the fourth and last project associated with the General Assembly Software Engineering Flex course I’ve been taking for the past 24 weeks. I developed a Full Stack app to showcase a perfume gallery where users can see and create fragrances. 

Deployed at [Cloud9 Scents](https://cloud9-scents.netlify.app/) <br>
Backend code can be found [here](https://github.com/claudia-pacheco/perfumes-backend)

## Tech stack

This time the backend was developed using Python with a Django REST framework that utilises a PostgreSQL database. As for the client side, I once again used React but decided to venture out with Material UI for the styling.

## How it works

The concept of this project is to allow users to access it as their fragrance wardrobe where they can see any fragrance and even create their own fictional scent. This enables them to explore the perfume world in more depth by getting to know a variety of brands and notes of the scents.
